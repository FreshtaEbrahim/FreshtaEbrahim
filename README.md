### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Freshta (she/her), a full-stack software engineer specialising in JavaScript technologies and agile team collaboration. My affinity lies in using code to create scalable solutions to real life problems, with a fondness of React and curiousity in cloud computing. When I'm not doing that, you'll find me hosting radio shows broadcasted on global radio stations NTS and Foundation FM :headphones:

My GitHub reflects my journey into programming, that I entered through the *[School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/)* bootcamp. Have fun exploring my development and progress :blush:

Feel free to drop me a message, I'm always down to talk tech! Connect with me on *[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/freshtaebrahim)* on drop me an email at *<freshtaebrahim@hotmail.co.uk>* :e-mail:
